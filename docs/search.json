You should use standard bibtex syntax for each entry, following the examples provided. If the resource you are using doesn’t already provide a way to generate a bibtex entry, I recommend using zoterobib to generate the appropriate syntax (must change the Bibliography style to “BibTeX generic citation style”). The entries currently in library.bib are intended to provide syntax examples that capture the range of entries you are most likely to use. You will need to delete and replace the contents of library.bib with your own citation entries.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nThe examples in library.bib are nicely formatted so you can read and follow the patterns, but formatting and order of the library.bib file doesn’t actually matter and will not be assessed.

    "text": "A First Look at the Coverage\nWe collected a total of 3168 abortion-related news articles for this analysis. Of these, 1739 were published by Fox News and the remaining 1429 by The New York Times, spanning from early 2020 through late 2024. Together, these articles provide a window into how two major media outlets approached abortion coverage across a period of significant legal and political change.\nTo trace how attention fluctuated over time, we first examined monthly trends in article publication. Both Fox News and The New York Times exhibited visible surges in abortion-related reporting across the 2020–2024 period. While our primary focus is on the Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization decision and its aftermath, earlier spikes in coverage are also notable. Attention intensified sharply in September 2021 with the enactment of Texas’s SB8 “heartbeat bill”, surged again in May 2022 when Politico leaked the Supreme Court’s draft opinion in Dobbs, and peaked in June 2022 when the Court officially overturned Roe v. Wade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBeyond the immediate aftermath of Dobbs, two additional peaks in abortion-related media coverage align with major electoral moments. The first appears in November 2022, during the U.S. midterm elections, when abortion rights were a central issue on state ballots across the country. Notably, Fox News overtook The New York Times in article volume — a reversal from earlier months when The Times had led during key judicial moments. This surge in Fox’s reporting likely reflects heightened partisan framing around abortion’s political salience, especially in contested states.\nA second uptick occurs in August 2023, during the Ohio special election, when voters decided whether to raise the threshold for constitutional amendments. The measure was widely understood as a proxy battle over abortion rights. While both outlets covered the vote, the media response was more subdued than in 2022 — perhaps due to its more localized scope despite national implications.\nThe most recent spike emerges in late 2024, with The New York Times reclaiming the lead in coverage volume. This increase likely corresponds with renewed national focus on abortion in the lead-up to the 2024 U.S. presidential election, where reproductive rights once again became a central campaign issue.\nWhile monthly patterns highlight media reactions to key events, they don’t fully capture the broader arc of attention. To provide a cumulative perspective, we plotted the running total of abortion-related articles over time. Although The New York Times often displayed sharper monthly peaks, the cumulative view reveals a different pattern: over the long term, Fox News produced a significantly larger volume of abortion-related coverage. Following the Dobbs decision, both outlets showed a sharp rise in article counts, but Fox News continued publishing abortion-related content at a faster pace. By the end of 2024, Fox News had amassed a much larger body of coverage compared to The New York Times."

    "section": "Introduction",
    "text": "Introduction\nLong a topic of debate across law, medicine, gender, and religion, abortion remains one of the most polarizing issues in American public life. That polarization deepened in June 2022, when the Supreme Court’s decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization overturned Roe v. Wade, the 1973 ruling that had established a constitutional right to abortion. The decision unsettled not only the legal framework around abortion, but also the broader discourse surrounding it. As states move in sharply different directions, media coverage has had to grapple with new divisions, new language, and new stakes.\nAt its core, the public debate still turns on a simple but deeply charged question: is abortion good or bad? How that question gets answered—or even framed—depends heavily on where one looks. News coverage of abortion varies sharply by ideological leaning. Conservative media outlets often emphasize religious and legal arguments, focusing on fetal personhood, state-level bans, and moral appeals (Jenssen 2013). In contrast, liberal media frequently frame abortion in terms of bodily autonomy, healthcare access, and gender justice, while highlighting the disproportionate impact of abortion restrictions on marginalized communities (Rohlinger 2015).\nIn this blog, we examine how abortion is framed by two ideologically distinct media outlets: Fox News and The New York Times. These platforms were selected for their national prominence, wide readership, and well-documented political leanings—Fox News is widely recognized as a conservative outlet, while The New York Times is identified as liberal-leaning (Mitchell et al. 2020; Pew Research Center 2014).\n\n\n\nImage\n\n\nWe complement this analysis with geographic policy data from the Guttmacher Institute, a leading research organization on reproductive health. Using tools such as sentiment analysis, topic modeling, and spatial comparison, we explore how media narratives align with state-level abortion laws and how discourse evolves in response to shifting legal landscapes."

    "text": "A Calendar of Changing Narratives\nTo understand how language and sentiment around abortion shifted in the media before and after the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, we mapped article AFINN sentiment scores across the two major outlets in a calendar heatmap format spanning 2020 to 2024.\nSince we’ve been talking about how Fox News devoted a large volume of coverage to abortion, let’s first take a closer look at the tone of that coverage.\n\n\nWhile Fox News consistently produced abortion-related articles throughout the 2020–2024 period, its emotional tone varied more subtly than expected. Most days register as light red or pale blue, which indicates slightly negative or slightly positive sentiment, with fewer extreme spikes than one might assume for such a polarizing topic.\nIn 2022, around the time of the Dobbs decision that overturned Roe v. Wade, we observe scattered patches of deeper red and blue. However, rather than clustering tightly around key events, these peaks appear spread out across weeks.\n\nInterestingly, sentiment remained relatively stable in 2023 and 2024, with more diffuse tonal variation. This could imply that while the political salience of abortion persisted, the emotional framing of Fox News coverage settled into a more routine cadence post-Dobbs.\n\nAfter exploring how Fox News covered abortion in both volume and tone, it’s worth asking: how does The New York Times compare?\n\n\nSurprisingly, it’s The New York Times that reads as more restrained. In contrast to Fox’s more visibly fluctuating sentiment, the Times displays a remarkably steady emotional cadence in its abortion coverage from 2020 through 2024. Most days are washed in muted reds and pale blues. There is consistently neutral or mildly toned language across the board.\nThe only noticeable deviation appears in spring 2022, just before the Supreme Court officially decided Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization. Being a liberal-leaning outlet, and one generally supportive of abortion rights, we expected the New York Times to lean more negative in tone around the Dobbs decision. So it’s surprising to see a spike in positive sentiment in the weeks before the ruling.\n\nThat moment of optimism might feel out of place given the looming loss of constitutional protections — but it likely reflects the way the stories were framed: not with defeat, but with mobilization. Articles during that time may have highlighted state-level protections, legal challenges, or grassroots organizing, which could register as “positive” in sentiment scoring, even if the context was defensive or reactive.\n\nFor example, an article celebrating the swift passage of abortion protections in certain states might score as “positive” based on language even though it was prompted by a national-level loss. Similarly, a story framing a restrictive abortion law as “historic” or “a major success” (even if opposed editorially) could also register as positive if the wording carried emotional approval.\nEven as article volume rises again toward the end of 2024, likely tracking with presidential election season, the emotional register stays steady. The New York Times seems to maintain its editorial evenness throughout."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Data Collection\nThis study examines abortion-related media coverage from Fox News and The New York Times. We focus on the period from January 2020 to December 2024. These two outlets were selected due to their national visibility and ideological contrast, and thus, we believe they were ideal for comparative analysis across a politically contentious issue.\nTo gather the articles, we developed two independent scraping pipelines. For The New York Times, we queried the internal search portal using the term “abortion,” restricted to the specified date range and English-language results. The search was sorted chronologically to allow the collection of complete temporal data. For Fox News, we accessed the abortion category under the Politics &gt; Judiciary section, where articles tagged by the editorial team were archived. To collect them, we built custom Python scripts that acted like virtual readers: they opened each site through a simulated browser, clicked through dynamic pages, and followed internal links just as a human user would. Behind the scenes, the scripts routed all traffic through the Tor network to anonymize activity and avoid being blocked. Using selenium-driverless, we intercepted each site’s internal API calls and extracted article content in full.\nIncluded in the dataset were articles categorized as news reports, editorials, and features, provided they contained substantive textual content. Articles that were duplicates, excessively brief, or consisted primarily of video embeds were excluded to preserve analytical quality. We also incorporated state-level abortion policy data from the Guttmacher Institute. This dataset provides information on bans, gestational limits, and trigger laws.\nAll content was scraped from publicly available webpages and accessed in accordance with each outlet’s robots.txt file. Our scripts mimicked respectful user behavior and made no attempt to access paywalled or private content. No user data or personal identifiers were collected at any point. All scraping and analysis were conducted locally, and results were used exclusively for non-commercial purposes.\n\n\nVariables and Measures\nEach article served as an individual unit of analysis. For each piece, we recorded the article title, publication date, and source outlet. While we originally intended to classify articles by type (e.g., news, feature, or opinion), structural inconsistencies across both websites limited our ability to do so during scraping; we plan to revisit this classification in future iterations. The full article body was extracted and processed using nltk. Then, we created a binary indicator to distinguish whether an article was published before or after the June 24, 2022 Dobbs decision. Cleaned text was used to compute word counts and to generate unigrams and bigrams by frequency and TF-IDF weighting.\nThe outcome of interest was article-level sentiment, calculated using the AFINN lexicon. Each word in AFINN is assigned a sentiment score between –5 (strongly negative) and +5 (strongly positive). While individual word scores fall within this fixed range, the aggregated sentiment scores we computed at the article level based on the mean of all matched terms could extend beyond these bounds depending on the length and density of sentiment-bearing language.\n\n\nData Analysis\nAfter wrangling, we performed lexicon-based sentiment analysis, topic modeling, co-occurrence network construction, and legal-geographic mapping.\nSentiment was measured by averaging AFINN scores across all matched words per article. Though this approach does not capture context or rhetorical nuance, it provides a method for comparing tone across time and outlet.\nWe ran Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic models separately by outlet and by pre-/post-Dobbs period to identify recurring thematic structures. The resulting topic-term and document-topic distributions were interpreted to assess how media framing shifted over time. LDA modeling was conducted using the topicmodels package in R and gensim in Python.\nTo visualize linguistic associations, we built word co-occurrence networks from bigram frequencies. Nodes represented terms, while edge weight reflected co-occurrence strength. These networks were rendered using force-directed layouts to highlight topic clusters and central vocabulary implemented using igraph and ggraph.\nFinally, we used the Guttmacher dataset to draft a U.S. abortion ban map, illustrating which states implemented total or near-total abortion restrictions post-Dobbs. This map was integrated with the media timeline to support interpretive framing.\nAll analyses were conducted using Python (for scraping) and R (for wrangling, modeling, visualization, and reporting).\n\n\nLimitations\nLexicon-based sentiment scoring is limited in scope and does not account for the syntactic or rhetorical context in which words appear. As such, emotion may be misrepresented in articles with subtle or indirect tone. Differences in article length, editorial style, and formatting between The New York Times and Fox News may also affect comparisons of sentiment scores.\nAs discussed in the main content of the blog, we observed that some articles, particularly pre-Dobbs features from The New York Times, appeared to carry a broadly positive tone based on sentiment scoring. However, closer reading revealed that this positivity often stemmed from emotionally charged language (e.g., words like “hope,” “support,” or “freedom”) used in quoting abortion rights advocates. Lexicon-based sentiment scoring, such as with AFINN, does not account for the context in which words appear. As a result, articles that include supportive quotes or passionate language even when the broader framing is neutral or critical may be mischaracterized in tone.\nWhile our dataset is limited to just two outlets and is not intended to represent the full diversity of the U.S. media landscape, we view this work as a step toward more expansive analyses. We hope it can inform and inspire future projects that broaden the scope of media coverage.\n\n\nFuture Work\nGiven the scope and limitations of this project, several potential improvements come to mind. Future projects could include additional news sources such as, but not limited to, regional papers, cable news transcripts, and digital-native platforms to increase breadth and representativeness. We are also interested in experimenting with alternative sentiment models and topic modeling techniques that better analyze rhetorical nuance and evolving language use.\n\n\nLibraries and Tools\nThis project used a wide range of R packages including tidytext (Silge and Robinson 2023), dplyr (Wickham et al. 2023a), ggplot2 (Wickham 2023a), stringr (Wickham 2023b), readr (Wickham et al. 2023b), tidyr (Wickham and Henry 2023), forcats (Wickham 2023c), and broom (Robinson and Hayes 2023). For network analysis, we relied on igraph (Csárdi and Nepusz 2006), ggraph (Pedersen 2023), echarts4r (Coene 2023), and visNetwork (Thieurmel and Nguyen 2023). Geospatial visualizations were created using leaflet (Cheng 2023) and sf (Pebesma 2023), and for topic modeling we used textmineR (Jones 2023) and topicmodels (Blei et al. 2003).\nWe also thank the Computer Science community, especially Thu Hoang ’28 and Ryan Ji ’26, for generously assisting with the web scraping components of the project.\n\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nBlei, D.

    "section": "Sentiment Calendar",
    "text": "Sentiment Calendar\nThe sentiment calendar was created to visualize fluctuations in the emotional tone of abortion-related articles across time in a way that captures both daily granularity and broader temporal rhythms. However, several practical challenges emerged. First, articles were published irregularly, with clusters during major events and long stretches without coverage. Second, not every day yielded enough data for reliable sentiment calculation. These gaps, if left untreated, would create abrupt holes in the calendar heatmap and obscure patterns of intensity and tone. Therefore, we introduced a structured calendar sequence spanning from January 1, 2020 to December 31, 2024 and implemented a light-touch imputation process strictly for visualization purposes. For days with no articles, sentiment scores were missing (i.e., NA). To preserve visual continuity in the calendar heatmap without injecting false sentiment, we applied linear interpolation using the zoo::na.approx() function.\nMathematically, linear interpolation estimates the missing sentiment value \\(s_t\\) at time \\(t\\) between two known values \\(s_{t_1}\\) and \\(s_{t_2}\\) as:\n\\[\ns_t = s_{t_1} + \\frac{t - t_1}{t_2 - t_1} (s_{t_2} - s_{t_1})\n\\]\nThis ensures that gaps are filled based on the slope between the two nearest known points. For example, if the sentiment on July 1 is \\(-2\\) and on July 3 is \\(4\\), then:\n\\[\ns_{\\text{July 2}} = -2 + \\frac{1}{2}(4 - (-2)) = 1\n\\]\nThis method is widely used for visual smoothing in time series displays when gaps are not analytically meaningful (Shumway and Stoffer 2017; Zeileis and Grothendieck 2005). We did not use interpolation for any modeling steps but only for visual continuity in geom_tile_interactive() rendering.\nRemaining missing values at the edges (i.e., consecutive NAs at the start or end) were conservatively replaced with 0, which we interpret as a neutral baseline rather than evidence of balanced tone.\nAs a disclaimer, the number of days from 2020 to 2024 totals 1,826. Our dataset includes over 3,100 articles, and because many days have multiple articles, the temporal coverage is dense. Thus, we are confident that linear interpolation did not substantially distort underlying sentiment trends.\nWe also acknowledge that linear interpolation is a relatively simple method and may not fully explain structural gaps in temporal coverage or non-linear shifts in sentiment dynamics. Ideally, future work would explore more principled approaches from the field of missing data theory, such as time-aware imputation with uncertainty quantification. Hopefully, we can revisit this aspect of our project after taking STAT404: Data Not Found: An Introduction to Missing Data Methodology taught by our wonderful STAT231: Data Science instructor herself, Prof. Katharine Correia, when it is next offered!"

    "text": "Topic Modeling and Network Visualizations\nLatent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is a generative probabilistic model used to detect latent thematic structures in large text corpora. The term latent refers to the fact that the topics inferred by LDA are not directly observable, but are hidden variables inferred from the co-occurrence patterns in the observed data (i.e., words). LDA assumes that each document \\(d\\) is associated with a topic distribution \\(\\theta_d \\sim \\text{Dirichlet}(\\alpha)\\), and each topic \\(k\\) is associated with a word distribution \\(\\phi_k \\sim \\text{Dirichlet}(\\beta)\\). For every word \\(w_{d,n}\\) in document \\(d\\), a topic \\(z_{d,n}\\) is first drawn from \\(\\theta_d\\), and a word is then sampled from the corresponding topic’s distribution:\n\\[\nw_{d,n} \\sim \\text{Multinomial}(\\phi_{z_{d,n}})\n\\]\nIn this formulation, \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) are hyperparameters for the Dirichlet priors: \\(\\alpha\\) controls the sparsity of topics within a document, and \\(\\beta\\) controls the sparsity of words within a topic.\nThe Dirichlet distribution is a multivariate generalization of the Beta distribution. It generates a probability vector of non-negative real numbers that sum to one. Essentially, a distribution over categories. For instance, if a document is composed of three topics, a sample from a Dirichlet distribution might be \\((0.7, 0.2, 0.1)\\), indicating the document is 70% about Topic 1, 20% about Topic 2, and 10% about Topic 3. Smaller values of \\(\\alpha\\) and \\(\\beta\\) (e.g., \\(&lt; 1\\)) yield sparse distributions, where documents concentrate on a few topics and topics on a few words. Larger values (e.g., \\(&gt; 1\\)) yield more uniform distributions. These priors allow LDA to reflect the assumption that documents are usually “about a few things.”\nWe experimented with values of \\(k\\) ranging from 4 to 12, but due to computational limitations and the exploratory nature of our analysis, we ultimately selected \\(k = 5\\). This choice also aligns with other media framing studies using LDA in political discourse contexts, such as (Roberts et al. 2014), which allows us to balance interpretability with thematic resolution.\nAfter fitting, we extracted topic–term probabilities, denoted \\(\\beta_{k,w} = P(w \\mid z = k)\\), using tidytext::tidy(). These represent the probability of word \\(w\\) appearing in topic \\(k\\), and should not be confused with the Dirichlet prior \\(\\beta\\) used in model initialization. We retained terms with \\(\\beta_{k,w} &gt; 0.015\\), to focus on high-association terms, and manually labeled each topic based on its top-ranked terms. For example, a topic dominated by “heartbeat,” “ban,” and “unborn” was labeled Pro-Life Messaging.\nTo further examine framing differences, we visualized topic structures as bipartite networks using igraph and visNetwork. Nodes represented topics and bigrams, and edges were weighted by \\(\\beta_{k,w}\\). Topic nodes were styled by outlet and time period, using box shapes and consistent color palettes, and interactivity allowed users to trace how themes emerged and diverged across time. Furthermore, one can see that shareed bigrams appeared across multiple topic nodes, which shows recurring rhetorical devices and contested framings that spanned ideological divides.\nWhile LDA is foundational in topic modeling, it is limited by the bag-of-words assumption and fixed topic structures. We look forward to revisiting these questions with more flexible methods, such as dynamic topic models and contextual embeddings, once STAT325: Text Analytics is next offered by Prof. Nicholas Horton!"

    "text": "Conclusion\nOur analysis reveals how abortion in post-Roe America is shaped by both media narratives and legal realities. Fox News and The New York Times differ sharply in tone, framing, and focus: one leaning into moral and political messaging, the other emphasizing institutional processes and rights-based discourse. Topic networks and sentiment trends show how these narratives evolve in response to legal shifts, with Texas standing out as a central figure in both media and law. Mapping state-level bans and exceptions further highlights the uneven and often contradictory geography of reproductive care. Together, our findings show that abortion is not just a legal issue or a media topics, but is a contested terrain of discourse, power, and access, playing out differently across headlines, states, and lives."
