## Introduction

Long a topic of debate across law, medicine, gender, and religion,
abortion remains one of the most polarizing issues in American public
life. That polarization deepened in June 2022, when the Supreme Court’s
decision in [*Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health
Organization*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/19-1392) overturned [*Roe
v. Wade*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18), the 1973 ruling that
had established a constitutional right to abortion. The decision
unsettled not only the legal framework around abortion, but also the
broader discourse surrounding it. As states move in sharply different
directions, media coverage has had to grapple with new divisions, new
language, and new stakes.

At its core, the public debate still turns on a simple but deeply
charged question: **is abortion good or bad?** How that question gets
answered—or even framed—depends heavily on where one looks. News
coverage of abortion varies sharply by ideological leaning. Conservative
media outlets often emphasize religious and legal arguments, focusing on
fetal personhood, state-level bans, and moral appeals
[@jenssen2013broadcast]. In contrast, liberal media frequently frame
abortion in terms of bodily autonomy, healthcare access, and gender
justice, while highlighting the disproportionate impact of abortion
restrictions on marginalized communities [@rohlinger2015abortion].

In this blog, we examine how abortion is framed by two ideologically
distinct media outlets: [Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com) and [The New
York Times](https://www.nytimes.com). These platforms were selected for
their national prominence, wide readership, and well-documented
political leanings—Fox News is widely recognized as a conservative
outlet, while The New York Times is identified as liberal-leaning
[@pew2014; @mitchell2020].

We complement this analysis with geographic policy data from the
[Guttmacher Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org), a leading research
organization on reproductive health. Using tools such as sentiment
analysis, topic modeling, and spatial comparison, we explore how media
narratives align with state-level abortion laws and how discourse
evolves in response to shifting legal landscapes.

## A First Look at the Coverage

We collected a total of `r nrow(articles)` abortion-related news
articles for this analysis. Of these, `r nrow(fox)` were published by
Fox News and the remaining `r nrow(nyt)` by The New York Times, spanning
from early 2020 through late 2024. Together, these articles provide a
window into how two major media outlets approached abortion coverage
across a period of significant legal and political change.

    # Tooltip & ID for monthly plot
    tooltip_text_monthly = paste0(
      outlet, "\nMonth: ", format(month, "%b %Y"),
      "\nArticles: ", monthly_n
    ),
    data_id_monthly = paste(outlet, "Monthly", format(month, "%Y-%m"), monthly_n, sep = "-"),

    # Tooltip & ID for cumulative plot
    tooltip_text_cumulative = paste0(
      outlet, "\nMonth: ", format(month, "%b %Y"),
      "\nArticles: ", cumulative_n
    ),
    data_id_cumulative = paste(outlet, "Cumulative", format(month, "%Y-%m"), cumulative_n, sep = "-")
  )

# Split for monthly plot
fox_monthly <- monthly_data_2 |> filter(outlet == "Fox News")
nyt_monthly <- monthly_data_2 |> filter(outlet == "The New York Times")

# Split for cumulative plot (reuse same df but different y-values)
fox_cumulative <- monthly_data_2 |> filter(outlet == "Fox News")
nyt_cumulative <- monthly_data_2 |> filter(outlet == "The New York Times")
```

To trace how attention fluctuated over time, we first examined monthly
trends in article publication. Both *Fox News* and *The New York Times*
exhibited visible surges in abortion-related reporting across the
2020–2024 period. While our primary focus is on the [*Dobbs v. Jackson
Women’s Health
Organization*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf)
decision and its aftermath, earlier spikes in coverage are also notable.
Attention intensified sharply in **September 2021** with the enactment
of [Texas’s SB8 “heartbeat
bill”](https://capitol.texas.gov/tlodocs/87R/billtext/pdf/SB00008I.pdf),
surged again in **May 2022** when *Politico* [leaked the Supreme Court’s
draft
opinion](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473)
in *Dobbs*, and peaked in **June 2022** when the Court [officially
overturned *Roe v.
Wade*](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf).

    opts_toolbar(saveaspng = TRUE)
  )
)
```

Beyond the immediate aftermath of *Dobbs*, two additional peaks in
abortion-related media coverage align with major electoral moments. The
first appears in **November 2022**, during the [U.S. midterm
elections](https://www.npr.org/2022/11/09/1135345050/abortion-rights-state-ballots-election-results),
when abortion rights were a central issue on state ballots across the
country. Notably, *Fox News* overtook *The New York Times* in article
volume — a reversal from earlier months when *The Times* had led during
key judicial moments. This surge in Fox’s reporting likely reflects
heightened partisan framing around abortion’s political salience,
especially in contested states.

A second uptick occurs in **August 2023**, during the [Ohio special
election](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/08/08/us/ohio-abortion-constitution-vote.html),
when voters decided whether to raise the threshold for constitutional
amendments. The measure was widely understood as a proxy battle over
abortion rights. While both outlets covered the vote, the media response
was more subdued than in 2022 — perhaps due to its more localized scope
despite national implications.

The most recent spike emerges in **late 2024**, with *The New York
Times* reclaiming the lead in coverage volume. This increase likely
corresponds with renewed national focus on abortion in the lead-up to
the [2024 U.S. presidential
election](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2024/us/elections/calendar.html),
where reproductive rights once again became a central campaign issue.

While monthly patterns highlight media reactions to key events, they
don’t fully capture the broader arc of attention. To provide a
cumulative perspective, we plotted the running total of abortion-related
articles over time. Although *The New York Times* often displayed
sharper monthly peaks, the cumulative view reveals a different pattern:
over the long term, *Fox News* produced a significantly larger volume of
abortion-related coverage. Following the *Dobbs* decision, both outlets
showed a sharp rise in article counts, but *Fox News* continued
publishing abortion-related content at a faster pace. By the end of
2024, *Fox News* had amassed a much larger body of coverage compared to
*The New York Times*.

## A Calendar of Changing Narratives

To understand how language and sentiment around abortion shifted in the
media before and after the Supreme Court’s landmark decision in [*Dobbs
v. Jackson Women’s Health
Organization*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/2021/19-1392), we mapped
article [AFINN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AFINN) sentiment scores
across the two major outlets in a calendar heatmap format spanning 2020
to 2024.

Since we’ve been talking about how *Fox News* devoted a large volume of
coverage to abortion, let’s first take a closer look at the tone of that
coverage.

<iframe src="../echarts/interactive_calendar_fox.html" width="100%" height="690px" style="border: none;">

</iframe>

While *Fox News* consistently produced abortion-related articles
throughout the 2020–2024 period, its emotional tone varied more subtly
than expected. Most days register as light red or pale blue, which
indicates slightly negative or slightly positive sentiment, with fewer
extreme spikes than one might assume for such a polarizing topic.

In 2022, around the time of the *Dobbs* decision that overturned *Roe v.
Wade*, we observe scattered patches of deeper red and blue. However,
rather than clustering tightly around key events, these peaks appear
spread out across weeks.

> Interestingly, sentiment remained relatively stable in 2023 and 2024,
> with more diffuse tonal variation. This could imply that while the
> political salience of abortion persisted, the emotional framing of
> *Fox News* coverage settled into a more routine cadence post-*Dobbs*.

After exploring how *Fox News* covered abortion in both volume and tone,
it’s worth asking: **how does *The New York Times* compare?**

<iframe src="../echarts/interactive_calendar_NYT.html" width="100%" height="690px" style="border: none;">

</iframe>

Surprisingly, it’s *The New York Times* that reads as more restrained.
In contrast to *Fox’s* more visibly fluctuating sentiment, the *Times*
displays a remarkably steady emotional cadence in its abortion coverage
from 2020 through 2024. Most days are washed in muted reds and pale
blues. There is consistently neutral or mildly toned language across the
board.

The only noticeable deviation appears in spring 2022, just before the
Supreme Court officially decided *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health
Organization*. Being a liberal-leaning outlet, and one generally
supportive of abortion rights, we expected the *New York Times* to lean
more negative in tone around the *Dobbs* decision. So it’s surprising to
see a spike in **positive sentiment** in the weeks *before* the ruling.

For example, an article celebrating the swift passage of abortion
protections in certain states might score as "positive" based on
language even though it was prompted by a national-level loss.
Similarly, a story framing a restrictive abortion law as "historic" or
"a major success" (even if opposed editorially) could also register as
positive if the wording carried emotional approval.

Even as article volume rises again toward the end of 2024, likely
tracking with presidential election season, the emotional register stays
steady. The *New York Times* seems to maintain its editorial evenness
throughout.

# Running the Narrative Race

To visualize how *The New York Times’* framing of abortion evolved over
time, we animated the top bigrams appearing in abortion-related articles
each month from **2020** to **2024**.

<iframe src="../echarts/animated_bar_charts_nyt.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;">

</iframe>

In **early 2020**, bigrams like *health care*, *pro life*, and *women's
health* were prominent, reflecting a healthcare- and
ideologically-focused framing of abortion. In **September 2021**, with
[Texas’s SB8 law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Texas_Senate_Bill_8)
going into effect, terms like *texas law* and *planned parenthood*
surged.

By **May and June 2022**, during the [leaked draft opinion of *Dobbs v.
Jackson Women's Health
Organization*](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/05/02/supreme-court-abortion-draft-opinion-00029473)
and the eventual [Dobbs
decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf),
legal terms like *court decision* became prominent and terminology
surrounding *rights* and *laws* shaped the overall discourse, marking a
shift to more court-centric, legal framing of abortion discourse.

Following the **Dobbs** decision, phrases like *overturn roe* and *court
decision* remained dominant. At the same time, healthcare-focused
language persisted with *health care*, while *ballot measures* rose to
prominence during state-level campaigns in
[Kansas](https://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article264005286.html)
and
[Ohio](https://www.npr.org/2023/11/08/1211521603/ohio-election-abortion-rights-issue-1).

The presence of terms like *12 weeks*, *15 weeks*, *shield laws*, and
*aid access* reflects the growing complexity of abortion policy
post-*Roe*, especially surrounding medication abortion and interstate
protections.

As the articles move through **2023** and **2024** mentions of *election
results*, *ballot measures* as well as the *republican sentate* and the
*democratic party* demonstrate the growingly politicized nature of
abortion articles. In **September 2024** as the election comes close
metions of *Kamala Harris*, *Donald Trump*, and *JD Vance* are at the
forefront of the discourse around abortion.

**Overall**, we see how *The New York Times* coverage adapted in real
time to political events—shifting from national healthcare debates to
increasingly legal and rights-based discourse.

We did the similar thing for Fox News.

<iframe src="../echarts/animated_bar_charts_fox.html" width="100%" height="500px" style="border: none;">

</iframe>

We consistently see *health care* as a primary focus each year, but
especially in **2020**, there was a heightened emphasis on *public
care*, with frequent mentions of phrases like *affordable care*, *care
access*, and *medical progress*.

A focus on the pregnancy and the fetus top bigrams, *unborn children*,
*fetal heartbeat*, and *partial birth* in in **February 2021**. Articles
in 2021 have an increasing focus on the pregnancy and the fetus when
disscusing abortion. While **2020** centered more on *medicine*, *public
health*, and social institutions impacted by abortion laws, **2021**
marks a shift toward individual experiences and situations of pregnancy,
mothers, and children.

During **May 2022** and **June 2022** the [*Dobbs v. Jackson Women's
Health Organization*
decision](https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/21pdf/19-1392_6j37.pdf)
is at the forefront of media with a large spike in *supreme court*,
*court decision*, and *court ruling* in the vocabulary of many articles.
After the descion there is an increased use in *anti/pro* discourse.
Terms such as pro life are matched with pro choice and anti abortion is
matched with pro abortion to reflect the focus on the polarized nature
of the abortion in the aftermath of the decision.

Throughout the entire four year, there are mentions of *communion*, and
the *catholic faith* in **November 2020**, *religious freedom*, in
**December 2020** and *satanic temple* in **Feburary 2023**, suggesting
relgious narrative and arguments surrounding abortion. We see more
striking terms such as *rape incest*, *gender identity*, and *15 weeks*
like we saw in the NYT articles, suggesting the complex narratives and
range of perspectives in the current media discussions about abortion.

This wider thematic spread reflects the surge in *media attention* and
*public discourse* in the lead-up to and aftermath of the overturning of
[*Roe v. Wade*](https://www.oyez.org/cases/1971/70-18)—capturing debates
around health care, law, religion, and personal trauma in equal measure.

# The Knots and Threads of Discourse

While identifying top bigrams reveals frequently used terms, it does
little to clarify the **deeper relationships between ideas** or how
discourse evolves over time. To capture the **semantic structure** of
abortion coverage in *Fox News*, we applied a **Latent Dirichlet
Allocation (LDA)** topic model to extract dominant themes and clustered
terms around them using a **bigram co-occurrence network**. This method
allows us to visualize how terms are grouped and how they relate to one
another within and across topics.

For a full description of our modeling process and visualization
methods, see the [Technical Appendix](technical_appendix.qmd).

Continuing our analysis of changes before and after the overturning of
*Roe v. Wade*, we compare topic and bigram networks across the two
outlets during both periods.

Below, we present two topic networks generated from *Fox News* articles:
one **before** the Supreme Court's decision in *Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s
Health Organization* (which overturned *Roe v. Wade*), and one **after**
the ruling.

::: panel-tabset
### Network of Fox News Topics, Pre-Roe

<iframe src="../echarts/network_fox_preroe.html" width="100%" height="750px" style="border: none;">

</iframe>

### Network of Fox News Topics, Post-Roe

<iframe src="../echarts/network_fox_postroe.html" width="100%" height="750px" style="border: none;">

</iframe>
:::

In the **pre-Roe network**, moral and religious framing occupied the
center of discourse. The largest topic hub, labeled *Moral Arguments*,
connects with terms such as *pro life*, *pro choice*, *abortion access*,
and *supreme court*, which suggests that abortion was portrayed as a
question of ethical conviction and individual responsibility. Religious
language appears throughout this network, with terms like *holy
communion*, *faith & institutions*, and *texas law* feeding into a
cluster that combines legal governance with religious values. At the
same time, judicial terminology, i.e., *court decision*, *ban abortion*,
*abortion law*, i.e., organizes around nodes such as *Federal Debate &
Drafts* and *Clinic Laws & Enforcement*, which emphasize the legal
contestation of abortion rights. Interestingly, terms like *president
trump* and *health care* sit somewhat outside the network's core but
remain tied to the moral and legal debate. This network reveals that
prior to the *Dobbs* ruling, *Fox News* framed abortion primarily as a
clash between moral order and legal authority because of religious and
ethical codes occupying a central role in how narratives were
constructed.

Consequently, in the **post-Roe network**, the structure of *Fox News*
discourse shifts in form and focus. Moral arguments remain present, but
they are now in in a landscape of policy enforcement and rhetorical
messaging. New thematic hubs appear, including *Pro-Life Messaging*,
*Political Rhetoric*, and *Pregnancy Centers & Alternatives*. The first
of these, *Pro-Life Messaging*, is tightly connected to emotionally
charged terms like *anti abortion*, *abortion restriction*, *rape
incest*, and *late term*, which suggests a more targeted effort to frame
abortion around specific scenarios and moral outrage. Political actors
and institutions take on a more visible role than before: *president
biden*, *vice president*, and *biden administration* now appear
alongside *supreme court* and *court decision* in the central cluster,
which show heightened politicization of the issue. Meanwhile, *Pregnancy
Centers & Alternatives* draws together terms such as *abortion clinic*,
*abortion access*, *abortion pill*, and *pro abortion*, signals a new
focus on the mechanisms of reproductive healthcare and the alternatives
promoted in states with abortion bans. The presence of language like
*life movement* and *reproductive health* further shows that the
discourse expanded from ideological stances to debates over service
provision, enforcement, and identity.

Having examined the thematic structure of *Fox News*’ abortion coverage,
we now pivot to **The New York Times**, whose approach to the topic
differs both in language and in conceptual emphasis. Using the same
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) modeling process, we extracted topic
labels from *New York Times* articles and mapped their co-occurring
bigrams into topic networks.

In the **pre-Roe network**, *The New York Times* centers its coverage on
institutional power and procedural framing. The largest hub, *White
House & Party Messaging*, is densely connected to terms such as
*president biden*, *vice president*, *democratic party*, *republican
party*, and *support abortion*. This reflects a narrative in partisan
strategy and executive messaging, especially from the Democratic
establishment. Nearby, the *Judicial Appointments* cluster includes key
terms like *judge barrett*, *justice thomas*, *ruth bader*, and *law
school*, which could suggest a framing that foregrounds long-term shifts
in the federal judiciary and their implications for reproductive rights.
The presence of *draft opinion*, *federal court*, and *chief justice*
reinforces the emphasis on legal architecture and decision-making power.
Notably, topics like *Healthcare & Public Access* and *Legislative
Pushback* overlap with terms such as *abortion ban*, *medication
abortion*, *birth control*, and *texas law*. This signals attention to
both clinical outcomes and state-level resistance. This network
highlights *The New York Times*’ commitment to covering abortion through
both the dual of governance and rights.

Afterwards, during the **post-Roe network**, the thematic structure
tightens, and the discourse becomes more explicitly political and
issue-specific. At the center is *Pro-Life & Court Battles*, connected
to terms like *abortion ban*, *pro life*, *supreme court*, *court’s
decision*, and *anti abortion*. This central node reflects the paper’s
continued attention to judicial dynamics but also marks a shift toward
the active strategies and campaigns shaping reproductive policy.
Adjacent to this is *Medication Abortion Access*, linking *medication
abortion*, *abortion care*, *abortion pill*, and *abortion access*,
which is a clear signal of increased focus on pharmaceutical options in
the wake of clinic closures and legal restrictions. Another prominent
cluster, *Political Institutions & Reproductive Health*, merges
legislative and executive figures—*kamala harris*, *democratic party*,
*president biden*, *white house*—with healthcare-related terms such as
*health care*, *abortion provider*, and *reproductive health*.
Interestingly, *Opinion & Media Figures* emerges as a thematic addition
in this network, which features voices such as *ezra klein*, *donald
trump*, *larry kramer*, and *jd vance*. These additions suggest a media
ecosystem in which individual commentators shape the terms of debate.
The presence of *project 2025*, *ballot measure*, and *pregnant woman*
within *Anti-Abortion Campaigns* shows how the post-Roe narrative
expanded to include grassroots activism and electoral politics, not just
institutional decisions.

Across both *Fox News* and *The New York Times*, the overturning of *Roe
v. Wade* triggered shifts in how abortion was framed, but the nature of
those shifts differed significantly between the two outlets. *Fox News*
coverage evolved from morally anchored narratives to more targeted
messaging and political mobilization, often emphasizing anti-abortion
rhetoric, pro-life identity, and campaign-style language. In contrast,
*The New York Times* consistently centered institutional structures,
which are courts, parties, and healthcare systems, while expanding its
focus after Roe to include pharmaceutical access, and public figures. We
could therefore see that the networks reflect two distinct approaches to
abortion discourse: one grounded in ideological advocacy and cultural
signaling, the other in institutional analysis and procedural
accountability.

# Cartographies of Care and Control

After focusing primarily on media discourse, it became clear that much
of the conversation around abortion is shaped by the Supreme Court and
the increasingly politicized nature of legislation. Our topic networks
frequently referenced specific states and court rulings which points to
a geography of reproductive governance that extends beyond rhetoric.
While discussing the social and legal impacts of *Roe v. Wade* through
media coverage is crucial, it is equally important to examine abortion
legislation itself, separate from the narratives that shape its public
perception.

To better understand this legal landscape, we turned to the [Guttmacher
Institute](https://www.guttmacher.org/), which provides comprehensive
and up-to-date data on abortion laws and policies across all 50 U.S.
states. Using their data, we visualized the geographic distribution of
restrictions, exceptions, and protective laws in order to identify
legislative trends. These maps complement our media analysis by showing
how legal realities are unevenly distributed across the country.

In our bigram and topic network models, **Texas consistently emerged as
the most frequently mentioned state, if not the only state mentioned by
name**, which shows its role in both media discourse and legislative
action. Its repeated presence in coverage from both *Fox News* and *The
New York Times* mirrors how Texas operates as both a policy bellwether
and a rhetorical symbol. It is a place where the politics of abortion
are especially contested and consequential.

This prominence is mirrored in the legal data as well. In the *Abortion
Bans Map*, we see varying bans across the United States based on
gestational duration. Southern states shaded in dark green, such as
*Texas* (as expected), *Mississippi*, and *Louisiana*, have implemented
**total bans**, which prohibit abortion in nearly all cases. Other
states have more complex legislation. *Arizona* and *New York*, for
example, allow abortion up to the point of fetal viability.

The *Abortion Exceptions Map* further illustrates how different states
define exceptions to their bans. These range from **threats to the
pregnant person’s life** to pregnancies resulting from **rape or
incest**. While some states list multiple exceptions, others allow only
one, or none at all. At first glance, states like *Colorado* and *New
Mexico* appear to lack exceptions, but when cross-referenced with the
bans map, it becomes clear that these states do not have abortion bans
in place to begin with, and therefore do not require exception clauses.

Other notable patterns also emerge: states like *Florida* and *Georgia*,
while restrictive, permit a higher number of exceptions. Meanwhile, much
of the West Coast and Northeast ensures broader access without relying
on exceptions at all. And throughout all of this, *Texas* remains
central. Not only as a legal outlier with one of the strictest bans in
the nation, but also as a dominant narrative force in national media.

# Conclusion

Our analysis reveals how abortion in post-*Roe* America is shaped by
both media narratives and legal realities. *Fox News* and *The New York
Times* differ sharply in tone, framing, and focus: one leaning into
moral and political messaging, the other emphasizing institutional
processes and rights-based discourse. Topic networks and sentiment
trends show how these narratives evolve in response to legal shifts,
with **Texas** standing out as a central figure in both media and law.
Mapping state-level bans and exceptions further highlights the uneven
and often contradictory geography of reproductive care. Together, our
findings show that abortion is not just a legal issue or a media topics,
but is a contested terrain of discourse, power, and access, playing out
differently across headlines, states, and lives.
