# Abortion News Article Scraper

## Scrape and extract abortion news data from Fox News (2020-2024)

This project collects news articles related to abortion from the Fox News website, specifically within its Judiciary section. The scraper targets articles published between January 2020 and December 2024 and extracts their titles, full text, publication dates, and URLs. The output is stored in a structured JSON format.

The scraper operates by simulating a web browser that can interact with modern JavaScript-heavy pages. It scrolls through content, opens articles, and extracts information while minimizing the chances of being blocked. It uses tools such as headless browsing and IP rotation via Tor.
