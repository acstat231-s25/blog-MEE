On Sept. 1, the Supreme Court stunned much of the country by passively allowing Texas Senate Bill 8 to take effect, banning most abortions in the state in obvious defiance of Roe v. Wade. Not quite 24 hours later, the court issued an actual decision confirming that it would not block the law. On Sept. 2, a coalition including the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the national organization whose affiliates operate more than 600 health centers around the country, convened a video meeting to coordinate a national response."

What did Roe v.

The court said states could not ban abortions before fetal viability, the point at which the fetus can survive outside the womb. That was around 28 weeks at the time and, because of improvements in medical technology, is around 23 weeks now."

Jackson Women’s Health Organization. It was clear that big changes were coming to U.S. abortion law, no matter what. The Mississippi law at issue bans abortion after 15 weeks of pregnancy, even though Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v. Casey recognize a right to choose abortion significantly later in pregnancy. So if the court sides with Mississippi in this case — as it is widely expected to do — then American abortion rights will be fundamentally undermined."

But if, as is widely expected, the Supreme Court upholds a Mississippi statute that bans most abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy and overturns or guts Roe later this year, I will be thinking about something else: not the legal precedent, but the role that lawlessness and terrorism — and the medical community’s response to it — played in hastening Roe’s demise."

Conservatives, for instance, tend to see poverty largely as a result of poor life choices, and liberals tend to understand that factors such as systemic discrimination, inequality and lack of educational opportunities strongly contribute to economic insecurity. It’s not that personal choices don’t matter, but systemic realities cut off certain choices and make others far easier. The left generally understands that choice doesn’t happen in a vacuum and that external factors, including culture and law, shape people, the choices available to them and what they find moral, practical or even possible."
