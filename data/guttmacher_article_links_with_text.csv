all-or-most-abortions-banned,Explore the policy,https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-abortion-bans,"Background The landscape of abortion access in the United States continues to shift rapidly in the wake of the Supreme Court’s June 2022 ruling in Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, which overturned Roe v. Wade and eliminated the federal constitutional right to abortion. Since then, many state legislatures have created new abortion restrictions and bans, and many have begun enforcing existing ones. Research has long indicated that abortion bans of all types have the greatest impact on people in marginalized groups. Individuals who face systemic racism and other forms of oppression may encounter compounding barriers to obtaining an abortion. Many state laws provide some limited exceptions to total bans and bans based on gestational duration. These exceptions are often described as compromises, but they obscure the harm of abortion bans. Most exceptions are designed to be unworkable, containing vague and contradictory language and imposing cumbersome requirements. The abortion restrictions detailed below represent some of the ways state laws and policies may prohibit or restrict a person’s access to abortion care. Guttmacher’s interactive map on state abortion policies and state legislation tracker contain additional information about current state abortion laws and restrictions on access. Definitions Gestational duration: An estimate of the length of time a person has been pregnant. This is typically defined as the number of weeks since the person’s last menstrual period (LMP), though some states define it as the number of weeks since conception. State legislation often uses gestational duration to define the arbitrary timelines of abortion bans and restrictions. Most state abortion statutes reference “probable gestational age,” which is typically determined by LMP; the weeks listed in the table below refer to LMP unless marked otherwise. Viability: A nonmedical term used to describe the point at which a fetus can survive outside the uterus, which is generally determined to be between 24 and 26 weeks LMP. Many statutory bans define limits on abortion based on the concept of viability. General health: Determined by a health care provider licensed to provide abortions and may include a pregnant person’s mental and emotional health. Physical health: Applies only to the physical function of the patient’s body and may even be restricted to major bodily functions. Lethal fetal anomaly: Fetal condition likely to be fatal before or shortly after birth."

targeted-regulation-of-abortion-providers,Explore the policy,https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/targeted-regulation-abortion-providers,"Background Abortion providers in the United States are subject to strict evidence-based regulations (such as state licensing requirements, federal workplace safety requirements, association requirements and medical ethics) to ensure patient safety. However, nearly half of states, 15 of which do not have a total abortion ban in place, have imposed additional regulations on abortion clinics. Most of these laws—referred to as targeted regulation of abortion providers, or TRAP laws—go beyond what is necessary to ensure patient safety. They vary widely in severity, though some are intended to be so burdensome that they shutter clinics that provide abortion care. The table below focuses on two of the most burdensome types of TRAP laws: Facility structural requirements. In many states, TRAP laws apply the facility requirements for ambulatory surgical centers to abortion clinics. These structural standards—such as specifications for procedure room size and corridor width—are not medically necessary for the safety of abortion care. Arrangements with local hospitals. These types of arrangements include admitting privileges that allow a provider to admit and treat patients at a hospital and transfer agreements that allow an abortion facility to transfer patients to a hospital in the event of complications. Such arrangements may be difficult to establish or maintain: For instance, admitting privileges often require a provider to admit a minimum number of patients per year—a standard that abortion providers typically cannot reach because abortion complications requiring hospitalization are rare. In addition, some states specify that clinics be within a stated distance from the hospital with which they have an agreement, a standard that may be particularly hard for rural clinics to meet. Like facility structural requirements, arrangements with hospitals are medically unnecessary."

counseling-includes-inaccurate-information-on-risks,Explore the policy,https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/counseling-and-waiting-periods-abortion,"Background Many states require patients to receive counseling before getting an abortion, whether it be a procedural or a medication abortion. In most of those states, patients must also wait for a specified period of time after receiving counseling before they can get their abortion. Some states with waiting periods also require in-person counseling, which necessitates two in-person visits: the first for counseling and the second for the abortion. Requiring that counseling take place in person, rather than via mail, fax, internet or phone, may be a barrier to receiving care at all, especially for people who must travel long distances to reach a provider, take time off from work, or secure child care or lodging. These dual requirements can increase costs and complicate scheduling, jeopardizing people’s ability to get the abortion care they need. Waiting periods for abortion are medically unnecessary. They are required for almost no other medical procedure, and they do not make abortion care safer. Instead, they aim to deter people from getting an abortion or to compel them to reconsider a decision that the vast majority are already certain of by the time they contact a clinic. Mandated counseling is also medically unnecessary because every state already requires that patients provide informed consent before undergoing medical treatment, meaning that patients must be given adequate and appropriate information about a procedure in order to understand and agree to it. However, abortion counseling requirements often undermine informed consent by making providers share information that is irrelevant or misleading. For example, some state counseling materials about abortion risks include misinformation about breast cancer or future fertility. Other states include misleading information on fetal pain that is neither necessary for care nor relevant at the gestational durations when most abortions take place. Many states include information in their counseling materials that is meant to promote childbirth, such as information about alternatives to abortion and requirements for paternal support. Mandated counseling content and method of delivery vary by state and are marked accordingly in the tables below. Most information is conveyed verbally and through written materials, though certain topics require only one method of delivery. The tables also indicate which states supply content—including misinformation—in written materials, even though their laws do not require counseling on those topics. Details on each state’s requirements can be found in the statutes listed in the attached citation chart."

prohibits-telemedicine-for-medication-abortion,Explore the policy,https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/medication-abortion,"Background Medication abortion has been available in the United States since 2000, when the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the use of mifepristone for abortion in a two-drug regimen with misoprostol. Mifepristone was first approved for use through seven weeks’ gestational duration and is currently approved through 10 weeks. It is also used safely off-label later in pregnancy. Unlike procedural abortion, medication abortion does not have to take place in a clinical setting—the pills can be taken in one’s own home. Decades of studies have shown that medication abortion is safe and effective. In 2023, medication abortion accounted for 63% of all abortions provided by clinicians in the United States, up from 53% in 2020 and 39% in 2017. In the wake of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the US Supreme Court decision in June 2022 that overturned the federal constitutional right to abortion, states across the country instituted total or early gestational duration abortion bans that prohibit both procedural and medication abortion. In January 2023, the FDA lifted restrictions that prevented patients from obtaining medication abortion pills at a retail pharmacy. Pharmacies must complete a certification form from the manufacturer to dispense the pills. Individuals cannot obtain the medication at a pharmacy in states that have a total abortion ban. Many of the states that allow abortion have imposed unnecessary restrictions on medication abortion that increase barriers to care. For example, half of all states limit its provision solely to physicians. This policy contradicts findings from the World Health Organization and other health and medical organizations that advanced practice clinicians, such as physician assistants and advanced practice registered nurses, can safely provide medication abortion. Some states explicitly prohibit the use of telemedicine to provide medication abortion, despite clinical evidence that this practice is appropriate and safe. Other ways to prevent telemedicine provision in practice include requiring an in-person exam before the medications are provided, requiring a provider and patient to be in the same room when the medications are dispensed, and requiring that a provider observe a patient taking the first dose. A few states prohibit a provider from mailing abortion pills to a patient. In some states, providers are required to give patients medically inaccurate information on the possibility of “reversing” a medication abortion after starting the regimen. Patients may be required to make an in-person visit after taking the course of medication abortion, necessitating another trip to the provider. Several states specify a cut-off for use of medication abortion that is earlier than the FDA’s approved timeframe."

Mifepristone was first approved for use through seven weeks’ gestational duration and is currently approved through 10 weeks. It is also used safely off-label later in pregnancy. Unlike procedural abortion, medication abortion does not have to take place in a clinical setting—the pills can be taken in one’s own home. Decades of studies have shown that medication abortion is safe and effective. In 2023, medication abortion accounted for 63% of all abortions provided by clinicians in the United States, up from 53% in 2020 and 39% in 2017. In the wake of Dobbs v. Jackson Women’s Health Organization, the US Supreme Court decision in June 2022 that overturned the federal constitutional right to abortion, states across the country instituted total or early gestational duration abortion bans that prohibit both procedural and medication abortion. In January 2023, the FDA lifted restrictions that prevented patients from obtaining medication abortion pills at a retail pharmacy. Pharmacies must complete a certification form from the manufacturer to dispense the pills. Individuals cannot obtain the medication at a pharmacy in states that have a total abortion ban. Many of the states that allow abortion have imposed unnecessary restrictions on medication abortion that increase barriers to care. For example, half of all states limit its provision solely to physicians. This policy contradicts findings from the World Health Organization and other health and medical organizations that advanced practice clinicians, such as physician assistants and advanced practice registered nurses, can safely provide medication abortion. Some states explicitly prohibit the use of telemedicine to provide medication abortion, despite clinical evidence that this practice is appropriate and safe. Other ways to prevent telemedicine provision in practice include requiring an in-person exam before the medications are provided, requiring a provider and patient to be in the same room when the medications are dispensed, and requiring that a provider observe a patient taking the first dose. A few states prohibit a provider from mailing abortion pills to a patient. In some states, providers are required to give patients medically inaccurate information on the possibility of “reversing” a medication abortion after starting the regimen. Patients may be required to make an in-person visit after taking the course of medication abortion, necessitating another trip to the provider. Several states specify a cut-off for use of medication abortion that is earlier than the FDA’s approved timeframe."

abortion-reporting-specific-to-minors,Explore the policy,https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/abortion-reporting-requirements,"Background For decades, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) has partnered with states to collect aggregate statistics on abortions in the United States. The CDC does not require states to submit abortion data, but most do so through state laws requiring abortion providers, hospitals and other medical facilities to submit regular reports. The information collected in these reports varies by state but typically includes the names of the medical facility and the clinician providing abortion care, the patient’s demographic characteristics (e.g., age, race, ethnicity, marital status and number of previous live births), the patient’s residence details (e.g., state or locality), the gestational duration of the pregnancy and the type of abortion provided. Given the overturning of Roe v. Wade, new attention is being paid to state abortion reporting requirements, based in part on concerns that they might facilitate surveillance and criminalization of abortion patients and providers. Even states that have banned abortion since the Dobbs decision continue to enforce mandated reporting for abortions provided under any existing exceptions to those bans."
